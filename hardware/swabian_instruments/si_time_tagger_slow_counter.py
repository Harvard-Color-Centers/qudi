This file contains the Qudi hardware modules for Swabian Instruments Time Tagger.
Implemented interface:
    - slow_counter_interface

=====================================================================================
README

In the case of Swabian Instruments TimeTagger device, each measurement instance
(TT.CountBetweenMarkers, TT.Counter, and so on) can analyze data stream from the same physical device
without interfering with each other. That is, there can be several 'virtual' qudi.hardware modules using
the same physical device.

To implement this, all hardware modules are subclasses of the base class SITimeTaggerBase.

The base class contains protected dictionary
    __device_ref_dict={'physical_device_seria_number': reference_to device}
containing references to each physical device (qudi instance can host multiple SI TimeTaggers simultaneously)
    This dictionary should never be accessed directly from inside an instance to avoid overwriting the references
    and non-local inter-module errors.
    Instead, use self.connect_to_device() method and self._tagger property (see below).

METHODS DESCRIPTION:

    -- Module Activation

    During activation [inside on_activate()], the a specific qudi.hardware module should call
        self.connect_to_device()
    which will take instance's self._serial_str and will check if a reference to a device with this serial number
    is already present in the cls.__device_ref_dict. If is not, this module is the first to use this deice and
    class method cls.add_device(serial_str) will be automatically called to add the device.

    If only one SI TimeTagger device is used within qudi instance, the _cfg_serial_str ConfigOption is optional and can
    be omitted: cls.add_device() will automatically detect the device and self.connect_to_device() will automatically
    update self._serial_str and self._model with the actual values, obtained from the device.

    If multiple SI TimeTagger devices are used within the same qudi instance, config for each hardware module MUST
    specify device's serial number in _cfg_serial_str ConfigOption. If it is not specified, cls.add_device() and
    self.connect_to_device() will add/connect-to the first device they found, thus it is unpredictable which device
    the module will be connected to.


    -- Measurement Initialization

    To create measurement instance, use self._tagger property, which implements read-only access to the device reference
